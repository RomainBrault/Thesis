This thesis has also been the opportunity to be part of a
collaborative work on anomaly detection with random forests, with other fellow
Ph.~D. students of \myUniTP. The following paper \citet{goix2016one} is based
on a original idea of Nicolas Goix, and is currently under review at
\acs{ECML}. The original paper can be found at
\url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01971.pdf}.
