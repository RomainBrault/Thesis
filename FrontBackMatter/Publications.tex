Some ideas and figures have appeared previously in the following
publications: \\

%\begin{refsection}[ownpubs]
   %\small
   %\nocite{*} % is local to to the enclosing refsection
   %\printbibliography[heading=none]
%\end{refsection}

\printbibliography[keyword=ownpubs, heading=none]

%\emph{Attention}: This requires a separate run of \texttt{bibtex} for your
%\texttt{refsection}, \eg, \texttt{ClassicThesis1-blx} for this file. You might
%also use \texttt{biber} as the backend for \texttt{biblatex}. See also
%\url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/128196/problem-with-refsection}.
