    ``We have at our command computers with adequate data-handling ability and
    with sufficient computational speed to make use of machine-learning
    techniques, \\
    but our knowledge of the basic principles of these techniques is still
    rudimentary. \\
    Lacking such knowledge, it is necessary to specify methods of
    problem solution in minute and exact detail, \\
    a time-consuming and costly procedure. \\
    Programming computers to learn from experience should eventually
    eliminate the need for much of this detailed programming effort.'' \\

Besides my advisor, I would also like to thank my thesis jury Prof. Liva
Ralaivola and Prof. Paul Honeine for their time.
\paragraph{}
This thesis would not have been possible without my collaborators Dr. Markus
Heinonen and Dr. Maxime Sangnier, whose help have been precious to developp
fully my ideas and publish. I would like to thank Dr. Nicolas Goix, Dr. Nicolas
Drougard and Ma\"el Chiapino with whom it has been a pleasure to collaborate on
a paper. Big thank to Alexandre Gramfort for helping me through the deployment
of operalib in the context of the misssion Paris-Saclay Center for Data
Science.
\paragraph{}
I would also like to acknowledge the Universit\'e d'\'Evry-val-d'Essonne for
hosting and funding\footnote{PhD grant numbered 76391} me for the first part
of my thesis and T\'el\'ecom ParisTech for the second part.
\paragraph{}
This manuscrpit is dedicated to my parents and familly for backing me up during
this three years and especially my grand parents for welcoming me any week-end
to their place to rest.
\paragraph{}
I am also thankful to all my colleagues at Evry: N\'eh\'emy Lim, Yves-Stan Le
