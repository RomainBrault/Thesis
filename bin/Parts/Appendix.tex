\chapter{Proofs of theorems}
\label{ch:proof_of_theorems}
\bigskip
\begin{justify}
In this appendix we detail the proofs of \cref{corr:unbounded_consistency} and
\cref{corr:bounded_infinite_dim_consistency}. These two corollaries applying on
compact subsets of Banach spaces are the consequences of more generic
propositions (\cref{pr:bound_approx_unbounded} and \cref{pr:bound_approx_bounded})
working on any compact subsets of Polish spaces. Eventually we give a proof on
the variance bound given in \cref{pr:variance_bound}.

\chapter{Relevant piece of code}
\label{ch:relevant_piece_of_code}
\bigskip
\begin{justify}
In the following, we give minimal short samples of Python code showing how to
implement efficient \acs{ORFF}. Each section represent an independent snippet
of code, and a simple copy-paste in a python editor should generate the
corresponding figure presented in this manuscipt.

\chapter{One Class Splitting Criteria for Random Forests}
\label{ch:one_class_splitting}
\bigskip
\begin{justify}
This thesis has also been the opportunity to be part of a
collaborative work on anomaly detection with random forests, with other fellow
Ph.~D. students of \myUniTP. The following paper \citet{goix2016one} is based
on a original idea of Nicolas Goix and a joint work with Nicolas Drougard and
Ma\"el Chiapino. It is currently under review at \acs{ECML}. Our original paper
can be found at
\url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.01971.pdf}.
