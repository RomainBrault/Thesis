\chapter{Bounding the error of the ORFF approximation} % Chapter title
\label{ch:concistency_and_generalization}
\bigskip
\begin{justify}
    In this chapter we refine the bound on the \ac{OVK} approximation with
    \ac{ORFF} we first proposed in \cite{brault2016random} and presented in
    \cite{braultborne}. It generalizes the proof technique of
    \citet{Rahimi2007} to \ac{OVK} on \ac{LCA} groups thanks to the recent
    results of \citet{sutherland2015, tropp2015introduction, minsker2011some,
    koltchinskii2013remark}. As a Bernstein bound it depends on the variance of
    the estimator for which we derive an \say{upper bound}.

\chapter{Consistency and Generalization bound for ORFF}
\label{ch:generalization_for_ORFF}
\bigskip
\begin{justify} 
    This short chapter deals with a generalization bound for the a regression
    problem with ORFF based on the results of \citet{rahimi2009weighted,
    maurer2016vector}. We also discuss the case of Ridge regression presented
    in \cref{ch:learnin operator-valued_random_fourier_features}.

\chapter{Application to time series modelling} % Chapter title
\label{ch:applications}
\bigskip
\begin{justify}
    This chapter shows how to use the \acs{ORFF} methodology to non-linear
    vector autoregression. It is an instanciation of the \acs{ORFF} framework
    to $\mathcal{X}=\mathcal{Y}=(\mathbb{R}^d, +)$. We also give a
    generalization of a stochastic gradient descent \citep{dai2014scalable} to
    \acs{ORFF}. This is a joint work with N\'eh\'emy Lim and Florence
    d'Alch\'e-Buc and has been published at a workshop of \acs{ECML}. It is
    based on the previous work \citet{Lim2015} for time series vector
    autoregression with operator-valued kernels \cite{brault2016scaling}.
