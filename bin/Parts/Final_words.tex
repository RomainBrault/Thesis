    To conlude our work we present some work in progress. We show practical
    applications of operator-valued kernels acting on an infinite dimensional
    space $\mathcal{Y}$. We give two examples. Firsti we show how to generalize
    many quantile regression to learn a continuous function of the quantiles on
    the data. Second we apply the same methodology to the one-class SVM
    algorithm in order to learn a continuous function of all the level sets. We
    conclude by presenting Operalib, a python library developped during this
    thesis which aims at implementing \acs{OVK}-based algorithms in the spirit
    of Scikit-learn \citep{pedregosa2011scikit}.
