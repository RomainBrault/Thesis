\chapter{Work in progress}
\label{ch:Perspectives}
\bigskip
\begin{justify}
    To conclude our work we present some work in progress. We show practical
    applications of operator-valued kernels acting on an infinite dimensional
    space $\mathcal{Y}$. We give two examples. First we show how to generalize
    many quantile regression to learn a continuous function of the quantiles on
    the data. Second we apply the same methodology to the one-class SVM
    algorithm in order to learn a continuous function of all the level sets. We
    conclude by presenting Operalib, a python library developed during this
    thesis which aims at implementing \acs{OVK}-based algorithms in the spirit
    of Scikit-learn \citep{pedregosa2011scikit}.

\chapter{Conclusion}
\bigskip
\begin{justify}
    To conclude this work we would like to summarize our contributions, and
    show how they answered the initial question of large-scale learning with
    \aclp{OVK}. Then we finish with some short and mid term perspectives.
